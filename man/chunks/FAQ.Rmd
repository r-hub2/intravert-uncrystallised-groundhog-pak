```{asciicast asciicast-setup, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
dir.create(.lib <- tempfile())
.libPaths(c(.lib, .libPaths()))
```

## How do I reinstall a package?

pak does not reinstall a package, if the same version is already installed.
Sometimes you still want a reinstall, e.g. to fix a broken installation.
In this case you can delete the package and then install it, or use the
`?reinstall` parameter:

```{asciicast faq-reinstall}
pak::pkg_install("tibble")
```

```{asciicast faq-reinstall-2}
pak::pkg_install("tibble?reinstall")
```

## How do I install a dependency from a binary package

Sometimes it is sufficient to install the binary package of an older
version of a dependency, instead of the newer source package that
potentially needs compilers, system tools or libraries.

`pkg_install()` and `lockfile_create()` default to `upgrade = FALSE`, which
always chooses binaries over source packages, so if you use `pkg_install()`
you don't need to do anything extra.

The `local_install_*` functions default to `upgrade = TRUE`, as does `pak()`
with `pkg = NULL`, so for these you need to explicitly use `upgrade = FALSE`.

## How do I install a package from source?

To force the installation of a source package (instead of a binary
package), use the `?source` parameter:

```{asciicast faq-source}
pak::pkg_install("tibble?source")
```

## How do I install the latest version of a dependency?

If you want to always install a dependency from source, because you want
the latest version or some other reason, you can use the `source`
parameter with the `<package>=` form: `<package>=?source`.
For example to install tibble, with its cli dependency installed from
source you could write:

```{asciicast faq-source-dep}
pak::pkg_install(c("tibble", "cli=?source"))
```

## How do I ignore an optional dependency?

```{asciicast faq-ignore}
pak::pkg_install(
  c("tibble", "DiagrammeR=?ignore", "formattable=?ignore"),
  dependencies = TRUE
)
```

The syntax is
```
<packagename>=?ignore
```

Note that you can only ignore _optional_ dependencies, i.e. packages in
`Suggests` and `Enhances`.
